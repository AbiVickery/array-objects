            <p>Have a var coins with a list of the different coins and what they have a value of. (excluding the $1 coin)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>A function for sorting the coins into groups of a certain number.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The var will have an array of three at the least.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It will then print (console.log) the total per currency.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It will then print (console.log) the total rolls per currency along with any remainder per currency.</p>
